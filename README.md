---500px portfolio

By using the the 500px API - https://github.com/500px/api-documentation
I have created a Photo Portfolio Page. 

The website is devided into static content and category pages that are being generated through API calls to 500px. 

The static content is saved in a content.json file. 
ex 
{pages: { title:"About", content:"This is my about page"}}

The Category Pages are comprised of a grid of images which you can click on to view them at source.
